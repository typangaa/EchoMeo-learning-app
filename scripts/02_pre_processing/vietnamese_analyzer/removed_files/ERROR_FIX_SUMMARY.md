# Vietnamese Analyzer Error Fix

## Problem Identified

**Error:** `KeyError: slice(None, 5, None)`
**Location:** `report_generator.py`, line 288 in `create_file_summary_text()` function

## Root Cause

The error occurred because:

1. In `analyze_individual_file()` function (line 132), the code was converting Counter objects to dictionaries:
   ```python
   'tone_distribution': dict(tone_patterns.most_common())
   'pos_distribution': dict(pos_counter.most_common())
   ```

2. Later in `create_file_summary_text()` function (line 288), the code tried to slice these as if they were lists:
   ```python
   for tone_pattern, count in stats['tone_distribution'][:5]:  # ‚ùå Error here
   ```

3. Python dictionaries cannot be sliced with the `[:5]` syntax, which caused the KeyError.

## Solution Applied

**Fixed the data structure storage** in `analyze_individual_file()` function:

```python
# BEFORE (causing error):
'tone_distribution': dict(tone_patterns.most_common())
'pos_distribution': dict(pos_counter.most_common())

# AFTER (fixed):
'tone_distribution': list(tone_patterns.most_common())  # Keep as list
'pos_distribution': list(pos_counter.most_common())    # Keep as list
```

## Why This Fixes the Error

- `Counter.most_common()` returns a list of tuples: `[('pattern1', count1), ('pattern2', count2), ...]`
- Lists support slicing with `[:5]` syntax
- The consuming code in `create_file_summary_text()` expects to iterate over tuples, which works with both formats
- By keeping the data as lists, we preserve the ordering and enable slicing

## Files Modified

- `report_generator.py` - Main fix applied
- `report_generator_backup.py` - Original file backed up

## Verification

The fix ensures that:
1. `stats['tone_distribution'][:5]` works correctly (list slicing)
2. `stats['pos_distribution'][:5]` works correctly (list slicing)
3. The iteration `for tone_pattern, count in stats['tone_distribution'][:5]:` works as expected
4. Data integrity is maintained (same information, different structure)

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify the fix:
- `test_fix.py` - Tests the modified function
- `demonstrate_fix.py` - Shows the difference between dict and list approaches

The Vietnamese analyzer should now run without the KeyError.
