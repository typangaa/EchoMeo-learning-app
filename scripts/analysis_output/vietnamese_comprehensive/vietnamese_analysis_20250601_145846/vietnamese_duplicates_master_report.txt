RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------------------------------
1. Review within-level duplicates - these may indicate data entry errors
2. Evaluate cross-level duplicates - high frequency words may legitimately appear across levels
3. Consider frequency-based deduplication for cross-level words
4. Verify that duplicate entries have consistent definitions and metadata
