============================================================
DUPLICATE ANALYSIS SUMMARY
============================================================
Within-level duplicates: 6
Cross-level duplicates: 2
Total unique duplicate words: 8

WITHIN-LEVEL DUPLICATES BY LEVEL:
----------------------------------------
Level A1: 2 duplicate words
  - tôi (appears 2 times)
  - cảm ơn (appears 2 times)
Level A2: 2 duplicate words
  - học sinh (appears 2 times)
  - thích (appears 2 times)
Level B1: 1 duplicate words
  - giáo viên (appears 2 times)
Level B2: 1 duplicate words
  - chính phủ (appears 2 times)
Level C1: 0 duplicate words
Level C2: 0 duplicate words

CROSS-LEVEL DUPLICATES:
----------------------------------------
học: appears in levels A2, B1
xin chào: appears in levels A1, A2

DETAILED ANALYSIS:
----------------------------------------

HIGH PRIORITY DUPLICATES (Multiple occurrences within same level):
- A1 Level: "tôi" and "cảm ơn" appear twice each
- A2 Level: "học sinh" and "thích" appear twice each  
- B1 Level: "giáo viên" appears twice
- B2 Level: "chính phủ" appears twice

MEDIUM PRIORITY DUPLICATES (Cross-level occurrences):
- "xin chào": Appears in both A1 (frequency 88) and A2 (frequency 76)
- "học": Appears in both A2 (frequency 70) and B1 (frequency 50)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
----------------------------------------
1. Review within-level duplicates - these may indicate data entry errors
   - Check if multiple entries have different definitions or metadata
   - Consider merging entries or keeping only the highest frequency version

2. Evaluate cross-level duplicates - high frequency words may legitimately appear across levels
   - "xin chào" (hello/greeting) is fundamental and should probably be in A1 only
   - "học" (to study/learn) could legitimately appear in multiple levels with different contexts

3. Consider frequency-based deduplication for cross-level words
   - Keep words in their highest frequency level
   - Move lower frequency duplicates to appropriate levels or remove them

4. Verify that duplicate entries have consistent definitions and metadata
   - Ensure all instances of "tôi" have the same POS tags and meanings
   - Check that frequency scores are reasonable and not inflated by duplicates

DATA QUALITY NOTES:
----------------------------------------
- Total vocabulary items analyzed: 35
- A1 Level: 9 words (highest frequency tier)
- A2 Level: 9 words (high frequency tier)
- B1 Level: 7 words (medium frequency tier)
- B2 Level: 5 words (low-medium frequency tier)
- C1 Level: 4 words (low frequency tier)
- C2 Level: 4 words (very low frequency tier)

The duplicate rate of 22.9% (8 unique duplicates out of 35 total words) suggests 
the need for systematic deduplication processes in the vocabulary dataset.
