# Missing Vocabulary Reports

This folder contains detailed analysis reports comparing raw HSK vocabulary data with enriched vocabulary files to identify missing words that need to be added.

## Generated Files (timestamped)

### ðŸ“„ Text Reports (`missing_vocabulary_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`)
**Human-readable comprehensive analysis**
- Summary statistics showing total counts and completion percentages
- Level-by-level breakdown of missing vocabulary
- Sample of detailed missing words with pinyin, frequency, and meanings
- Perfect for quick review and understanding gaps

### ðŸ“Š CSV Data (`missing_vocabulary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`)
**Machine-readable data for systematic processing**
- Complete list of all missing vocabulary across all HSK levels
- Columns: HSK_Level, Simplified, Pinyin, Frequency, POS, Meanings
- Import into Excel/Google Sheets for sorting and filtering
- Use for prioritizing which words to add first based on frequency

### ðŸ”§ JSON Summary (`analysis_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`)
**Structured data for programmatic access**
- Complete statistics and metadata about the analysis
- Missing words organized by HSK level
- Level completion percentages and counts
- Perfect for automated processing or web dashboard integration

## How to Interpret Results

### Completion Percentages
- **100%**: All raw vocabulary has been enriched (complete)
- **90-99%**: Nearly complete, just a few words missing
- **50-89%**: Partially complete, significant work needed
- **0-49%**: Mostly missing, requires substantial enrichment
- **0%**: No enriched file exists yet

### Priority Levels
1. **High Frequency Words** (500+): Essential vocabulary, add immediately
2. **Medium Frequency Words** (100-499): Important for comprehensive coverage
3. **Low Frequency Words** (1-99): Nice to have, lower priority
4. **No Frequency Data**: Review individually for importance

### HSK Level Focus
- **HSK 1-3**: Foundation levels, should be prioritized for completion
- **HSK 4-6**: Intermediate levels, important for comprehensive learning
- **HSK 7**: Advanced level, large vocabulary set, can be done in phases

## Typical Analysis Results

Based on your data structure, expect to see:
- **HSK 1-3**: Small gaps (a few missing words per level)
- **HSK 4-7**: Large gaps (hundreds to thousands of missing words)
- **Total Gap**: Likely 70-80% of vocabulary needs enrichment

## Next Steps After Analysis

1. **Review Text Report**: Start with the human-readable summary
2. **Open CSV in Excel**: Sort by frequency to prioritize high-impact words
3. **Focus on HSK 1-3**: Complete foundation levels first
4. **Batch Process**: Use the CSV data to systematically add missing vocabulary
5. **Re-run Analysis**: Track progress after adding enriched vocabulary
