## Architecture Overview

This is a React-based multi-language learning platform with TypeScript, built using Vite as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with Capacitor wrapper for cross-platform deployment. The application features a mobile-first design with comprehensive vocabulary study tools and supports multiple language pairs for flexible language learning.

### Core Data Systems

**Vocabulary Management**: Extensible vocabulary systems with unified favorites management supporting multiple language pairs:
- Regular vocabulary (CEFR levels A1-C2) - foundational language learning content
- HSK vocabulary (Chinese proficiency levels 1-6) with enriched data from `assets/data/hsk/`
- Vietnamese vocabulary (levels 1-6, mapped to CEFR A1-C1) with enriched data from `assets/data/vietnamese/`
- **Multi-Language Pair Architecture**: Designed to support additional language pairs (e.g., English-Spanish, French-German, Japanese-Korean) through the same data loading and component patterns

**Data Loading**: Progressive loading system implemented in `enrichedHSKLoader.ts` and `enrichedVietnameseLoader.ts` for large datasets. Uses dynamic imports from assets folder and caching for performance. Both loaders support levels 1-6 with proper error handling and data validation.

**Spaced Repetition**: Custom algorithm in `useSpacedRepetition.ts` with localStorage persistence, using intervals [1, 3, 7, 14, 30, 90] days.

**Progress Tracking Systems**: 
- Reading progress tracking in `readingProgress.ts` for maintaining vocabulary position across study sessions
- Lesson completion tracking in `lessonCompletion.ts` with localStorage persistence for flashcard lesson progress
- Both systems use singleton patterns for consistent state management

### Key Architectural Patterns

**Zustand State Management**: Comprehensive store architecture with middleware:
- Modular store slices: `appSlice`, `uiSlice`, `audioSlice`, `vocabularySlice`, `progressSlice`
- **Language Pair Preferences**: User-configurable learning direction with English supplement toggle
- Persistent state with localStorage via `persist` middleware
- DevTools integration for debugging
- Memoized selectors for performance optimization
- Stable hook patterns to prevent re-renders

**Audio Service**: Enhanced singleton service (`audioService.ts`) using Web Speech API for Vietnamese/Chinese pronunciation. Features comprehensive voice management with:
- Automatic Hong Kong SAR voice filtering for better quality
- Yating voice prioritization as default for Chinese
- Configurable settings (volume, rate, pitch) with localStorage persistence
- Audio interruption handling to prevent overlapping playback
- Voice selection algorithms prioritizing local over online voices

**Component Structure**: 
- Common components in `components/common/` (Layout, Navbar, AudioButton, etc.)
- **Dynamic Navigation**: Navbar that adapts based on user's target language preferences
- Vocabulary components with type-specific implementations (HSK, Vietnamese, regular)
- **Simplified Vocabulary Cards**: Cleaner design with reduced visual complexity and better focus
- Mobile-optimized study components with swipe navigation and touch gestures
- **Language-Aware Flashcards**: Show only relevant flashcard options based on learning direction
- Complete flashcard system with 3D flip animations and practice modes for all vocabulary types
- Reading system with parallel text and vocabulary lookup
- Bug reporting system integrated into vocabulary cards
- **English Supplement Support**: Consistent optional English display across all vocabulary components

**shadcn/ui Integration**: Modern UI component library built on Radix UI and Tailwind CSS:
- **Component Library**: High-quality, accessible components with consistent design system
- **Setup**: Configured with TypeScript support and proper path aliases (`@/components`, `@/lib/utils`)
- **Theme System**: CSS variables for light/dark theme support integrated with existing dark mode
- **Utility Function**: `cn()` utility in `src/lib/utils.ts` for className merging with clsx and tailwind-merge
- **Configuration**: `components.json` for shadcn/ui CLI configuration with proper aliases
- **Dependencies**: Includes class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge, and lucide-react for icons
- **Adding Components**: Use `npx shadcn@latest add <component-name>` to add new components
- **Customization**: Components can be customized by editing files in `src/components/ui/`
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing Tailwind CSS setup and mobile-first design

**Internationalization (i18n)**: Comprehensive interface language support with:
- Translation system in `src/i18n/` with files for English, Vietnamese, Simplified Chinese, and Traditional Chinese
- `useTranslation` hook for accessing translations throughout the application
- Language detection and persistence via Zustand store with localStorage
- Smart browser language detection supporting Traditional Chinese variants (zh-TW, zh-HK, zh-Hant)
- Dynamic array translation support for lists and features
- Language selector in SettingsPage for user preference management

### Data Processing Pipeline

The project includes extensive Python scripts in `scripts/` for:
- HSK vocabulary processing and enrichment (`05_vocabulary_processing/`)
- Vietnamese vocabulary generation and analysis
- Cantonese vocabulary generation from HSK data using Ollama AI
- Audio file generation and mapping
- Data validation and duplicate detection

### Important Technical Details

## Development Guidelines

When using shadcn/ui components:
- Import components from `@/components/ui/` using the configured path alias
- Use the `cn()` utility function from `@/lib/utils` for conditional className merging
- Prefer shadcn/ui components over custom implementations for common UI patterns (buttons, inputs, modals, etc.)
- Customize components by editing the generated files in `src/components/ui/` rather than overriding with CSS
- Follow the component's built-in prop interface for theming and variants
- Use `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` to add new components as needed
- Components automatically respect the existing dark/light theme system via CSS variables
- Ensure mobile responsiveness when using shadcn/ui components in the mobile-first design

When working with dynamic navigation and language pairs:
- Use `useAppStore((state) => state.languagePairPreferences)` to access current language learning direction
- Check `toLanguage` property to determine which navigation items to show (HSK for 'mandarin', Vietnamese for 'vi')
- Always validate language pair combinations against supported pairs: EN‚ÜíMandarin, EN‚ÜíVietnamese, VI‚ÜíMandarin, Mandarin‚ÜíVietnamese
- Use `showEnglishSupplement` setting consistently across all vocabulary components
- English supplement should auto-disable when `fromLanguage` is 'en' to avoid redundancy

When implementing English supplement support:
- Access setting via `useAppStore((state) => state.languagePairPreferences.showEnglishSupplement)`
- Apply conditional rendering: `{item.english && showEnglishSupplement && (<EnglishContent />)}`
- Ensure examples include English when supplement is enabled: `{example.english && showEnglishSupplement && ...}`
- Maintain consistent English styling: `text-green-600 dark:text-green-400` for English content
- English content should always be supplementary/secondary in visual hierarchy

When working with vocabulary data:
- Always use the appropriate data loader (`enrichedHSKLoader`, `enrichedVietnameseLoader`)
- Both loaders support levels 1-6 with proper validation and error handling
- Ensure unique IDs across all vocabulary types using the established ID ranges
- Use Zustand stores for state management with memoized selectors
- Follow the progressive loading pattern for large datasets

When adding audio features:
- Use the singleton `audioService` for consistency
- Audio interruption is handled automatically via `audioService.stop()` before new playback
- Support both Vietnamese (`vi-VN`) and Chinese (`zh-CN`) language codes
- Handle Web Speech API availability gracefully
- AudioButton component uses optional chaining for robust error handling
- Use SettingsPage for user audio preferences (voice selection, volume, rate, pitch)
- Default audio settings: volume 1.0, rate 0.8x, pitch 1.0

For flashcard development:
- Complete lesson-based flashcard system for HSK and Vietnamese vocabulary
- 20 words per lesson with responsive pagination (5 lessons mobile, 10 desktop)
- Lesson completion tracking with visual progress indicators and celebration messages
- Progress summaries with percentage completion and lesson counts
- Integrate with the spaced repetition system and lesson completion tracking
- Use the existing CSS animations in `flashcard.css`
- Support language direction switching (Vietnamese‚ÜíChinese or Chinese‚ÜíVietnamese)
- Vietnamese flashcards don't show English on the front (focus on VN-CN translation)
- Both HSK and Vietnamese flashcard systems have feature parity

For interface translations:
- Always use the `useTranslation` hook for user-facing text
- Keep learning content (vocabulary words) in original languages for educational integrity
- Translation keys use nested structure (e.g., 'vocabulary.hsk.about.title')
- Support dynamic parameter replacement with {param} syntax
- Array translations automatically handled for lists and features
- Language preference persists across sessions via localStorage

For mobile development:
- Mobile-first design approach for all new features
- Support touch gestures and swipe navigation
- Ensure responsive layouts with proper breakpoints
- Test on various screen sizes and orientations
- Use mobile-specific UI patterns in study pages
- PWA-optimized design for app-like experience
- Capacitor-compatible components for native deployment

For multi-language pair development:
- Follow established data loading patterns when adding new language pairs
- Use consistent ID generation schemes (assign unique ranges for each language pair)
- Implement language pair-specific loaders following `enrichedHSKLoader.ts` pattern
- Create dedicated components for each language pair in appropriate subdirectories
- Maintain unified favorites and progress tracking across all language pairs
- Ensure audio service supports additional language codes and voice selection
- Follow existing routing patterns for new language pair pages

For bug reporting:
- Use `bugReport.ts` utility for vocabulary item issues
- Include structured vocabulary data and technical information
