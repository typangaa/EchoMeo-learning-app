# Missing Vocabulary Analysis - Implementation Summary

## Files Created

### 1. **find_missing_vocabulary.py**
Main analysis script that:
- Loads raw HSK data from JSON files (1.json - 7.json)
- Loads enriched vocabulary data (hsk*_enriched.json)
- Compares the datasets to find missing words
- Generates comprehensive reports in multiple formats

### 2. **run_missing_analysis.bat**
Convenient batch file to run the analysis with a single double-click

### 3. **analysis_output/ folder**
Dedicated folder for all analysis results with README documentation

## Analysis Features

### Data Loading
- **Raw Data**: Extracts `simplified` characters from HSK JSON files
- **Enriched Data**: Extracts `item` fields from enriched vocabulary files
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing files and data errors

### Analysis Capabilities
- **Gap Detection**: Identifies words in raw data missing from enriched data
- **Level-by-Level Breakdown**: Shows completion status for each HSK level
- **Word Details**: Extracts pinyin, frequency, POS, and meanings for missing words
- **Statistics**: Calculates completion percentages and gap analysis

### Output Formats

1. **Text Report** (`missing_vocabulary_report_TIMESTAMP.txt`)
   - Human-readable comprehensive report
   - Summary statistics and level breakdowns
   - Detailed missing word lists with metadata

2. **CSV Data** (`missing_vocabulary_TIMESTAMP.csv`)
   - Machine-readable format for Excel/database import
   - Columns: HSK_Level, Simplified, Pinyin, Frequency, POS, Meanings
   - Perfect for systematic processing

3. **JSON Summary** (`analysis_summary_TIMESTAMP.json`)
   - Structured data for programmatic access
   - Complete statistics and missing word lists
   - Suitable for automated workflows

## Usage Instructions

### Quick Start
1. Double-click `run_missing_analysis.bat`
2. Check `analysis_output/` folder for results
3. Start with the `.txt` report for overview

### Advanced Usage
- Run `python find_missing_vocabulary.py` directly
- Modify script parameters as needed
- Use CSV/JSON outputs for data processing

## Expected Results

Based on your mention of missing vocabulary in HSK1, the analysis will likely show:
- Total vocabulary counts for each HSK level
- Specific missing words with their details
- Completion percentages to prioritize which levels need work
- Detailed word information to help with enrichment process

## Next Steps

After running the analysis:
1. **Review Results**: Check the text report for overview
2. **Prioritize**: Use frequency data to identify most important missing words
3. **Enrich Data**: Add missing vocabulary to enriched files systematically
4. **Re-analyze**: Run analysis again to track progress

The analysis will help you systematically identify and address gaps in your enriched vocabulary data!
