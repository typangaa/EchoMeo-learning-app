# HSK Enriched Vocabulary Integration

## Overview

This update integrates the enriched HSK Level 1 vocabulary data with Vietnamese translations into the language learning application. The system has been simplified to focus on the available enriched data rather than the complex multi-part loading system that was previously in place.

## What's New

### 🎯 Focused Implementation
- **HSK Level 1 Only**: Currently supports only HSK Level 1 with enriched Vietnamese translations
- **Simplified Loading**: Removed complex multi-part loading system
- **Better Error Handling**: Clear messages when unavailable levels are requested
- **Enhanced UI**: Better feedback and statistics display

### 📊 Data Structure
The enriched HSK data includes:
- **Multiple Meanings**: Each word can have multiple meanings with usage frequency
- **Vietnamese Translations**: Accurate Vietnamese translations for each meaning
- **Example Sentences**: Real examples in Chinese, Vietnamese, and English
- **Part of Speech**: Grammatical categories for better understanding
- **Usage Frequency**: Indicators of how commonly each meaning is used

### 🔧 Technical Changes

#### Updated Files:
1. **`hooks/useHSKVocabulary.ts`**: Updated to use enriched data loader
2. **`components/vocabulary/HSKVocabularyList.tsx`**: Enhanced UI with better feedback
3. **`data/enrichedHSKLoader.ts`**: Cleaned up and optimized loader
4. **`pages/HSKVocabularyPage.tsx`**: Updated page with better information

#### Key Features:
- **Progressive Loading**: Smooth loading experience with progress indication
- **Smart Caching**: Vocabulary is cached to avoid repeated loading
- **Comprehensive Search**: Search across Chinese characters, pinyin, Vietnamese, and English
- **Favorites System**: Users can bookmark vocabulary items
- **Statistics**: Real-time statistics about vocabulary and learning progress

## How to Use

### For Users:
1. Navigate to the HSK page
2. HSK Level 1 will be available with full Vietnamese translations
3. Use the search box to find specific words
4. Click the star (☆) to add words to favorites
5. Toggle between "All Vocabulary" and "Favorites" views

### For Developers:

#### Loading HSK Data:
```typescript
import { loadEnrichedHSKLevel } from '../data/enrichedHSKLoader';

// Load HSK Level 1
const vocabulary = await loadEnrichedHSKLevel(1);
```

#### Using the Hook:
```typescript
import useHSKVocabulary from '../hooks/useHSKVocabulary';

function MyComponent() {
  const { vocabulary, loading, error, loadLevel } = useHSKVocabulary(1);
  
  // vocabulary contains enriched VocabularyItem[]
  // loading indicates if data is being fetched
  // error contains any loading errors
}
```

## Data Format

### Input Format (hsk1_enriched.json):
```json
{
  "item": "一",
  "pinyin": "yī",
  "meanings": [
    {
      "chinese": "数字一；表示单一；表示全部",
      "english": "the number one ; a single ; all",
      "vietnamese": "số một ; một ; toàn bộ",
      "part_of_speech": "num/adj",
      "usage_frequency": "very common",
      "examples": [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Output Format (VocabularyItem):
```typescript
{
  id: number,
  chinese: string,
  vietnamese: string,
  pinyin: string,
  english: string,
  level: "A1" | "A2" | "B1" | "B2" | "C1" | "C2",
  category: string,
  examples?: Array<{
    vietnamese: string,
    chinese: string,
    pinyin: string
  }>
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features:
- **HSK Levels 2-7**: Additional vocabulary levels with Vietnamese translations
- **Audio Support**: Text-to-speech for Chinese and Vietnamese
- **Spaced Repetition**: Smart review system based on learning progress
- **Character Analysis**: Stroke order and radical information
- **Advanced Search**: Filter by frequency, part of speech, etc.

### Adding New Levels:
1. Create `hsk{level}_enriched.json` in `/public/data/hsk/`
2. Update `availableLevels` array in `useHSKVocabulary.ts`
3. Test with the integration test file

## Testing

Run the integration test:
```typescript
import testHSKIntegration from '../data/testHSKIntegration';
testHSKIntegration(); // Check browser console for results
```

## File Structure

```

├── hooks/
│   └── useHSKVocabulary.ts          # Main hook for HSK data
├── components/vocabulary/
│   └── HSKVocabularyList.tsx        # UI component for HSK vocabulary

```

## Performance Notes

- **Caching**: Data is cached after first load for better performance
- **Progressive Loading**: Large datasets are loaded in chunks
- **Memory Efficient**: Only requested levels are loaded into memory
- **Search Optimization**: Client-side search is optimized for real-time results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"HSK Level X is not available"**: Only HSK Level 1 is currently supported
2. **Loading errors**: Check that `hsk1_enriched.json` exists in `/public/data/hsk/`
3. **Search not working**: Ensure data is fully loaded before searching
4. **Favorites not persisting**: Check browser localStorage is enabled

### Debug Mode:
The loader includes console logging for debugging. Check browser console for detailed loading information.
